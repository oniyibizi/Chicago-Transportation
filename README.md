## Executive Summary:
The usage of e-scooters is quickly emerging as a popular method of transportation in various metropolitan cities. In the summer of 2019 the city of Chicago launched their own pilot program to track rider usage. With the growing interest in this method of transportation, it is important for the city to determine if they want to invest and allow companies to operate these e-scooters in Chicago. 



## Business Case:
Analyze the E-scooter pilot program in addition to other methods of transportation and their impacts to better prepare governmental agencies when planning transportation infrastructure for their communities.
